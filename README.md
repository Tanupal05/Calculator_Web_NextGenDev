#This HTML document creates a simple calculator interface styled with CSS. It includes buttons for digits, operators (+, -, *, /), special functions (AC, DEL), and an equals (=) button. JavaScript handles button clicks to update an input field with entered values or perform calculations using the `eval()` function. Styling uses a gradient background, Poppins font, and CSS for responsive layout and button appearance. The calculator allows users to input expressions, perform basic arithmetic, clear inputs, and delete characters. Overall, it provides an interactive and visually appealing calculator experience using fundamental web technologies.
